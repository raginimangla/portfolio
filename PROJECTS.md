# **Projects**

Below is a summary of some of my main projects that I have done over the years. This includes my experience as a Senior Technical Writer with Oracle, working on the Oracle Primavera Cloud application, and my experience as an Instructional Designer developing training materials for mainly ERP systems.

## **User Documentation**

As a technical writer in the Construction and Engineering documentation team, I write and update user documentation for the new features that are developed each release.

## **Administration Guides**

**Context**: I played a pivotal role in enhancing the Oracle Primavera Cloud administration guides. Primavera Cloud is a cloud-based enterprise application for construction project management. Upon joining, the application's administration guide was rudimentary. Given the centrality of application administration, my task was not only to document new features but also to improve existing content. I created quick-reference topics for the application administrators to define the configuration workflow and their tasks within the application. This helped reduce the administration related support tickets by at least 20%.

**Contributions**:

My contributions to the project include the following:

* Created the Getting Started workflow topic -[ https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/207895.htm#t213289](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/207895.htm#t213289)
* Documented the configuration workflow for application administrators:[https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/admin/app_admin_guide/89152.htm#t8915](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/admin/app_admin_guide/89152.htm#t89152)
* Defined the application administrator permissions sets within the application:[ https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/admin/app_admin_guide/99154.htm#subhead_applicationadministratorprivil8](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/admin/app_admin_guide/99154.htm#subhead_applicationadministratorprivil8)
* Added integration and import sections

    * Import -[https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/admin/app_admin_guide/186815.htm#t186815](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/admin/app_admin_guide/186815.htm#t186815)
* Add content for new features and find areas of improvement for existing content

### **API Documentation**

**Context**: The API documentation for Primavera Cloud includes API references guides for REST and GraphQL APIs. It also includes Get Started content, which is solely written and managed by the documentation writer. The API reference part of the guides is jointly owned and managed by the technical writer and the developers.

**Project Link**:  [Oracle Primavera Cloud REST API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/English/integration/primavera_rest_api/index.html)

**Contributions:**

My contributions to the project include the following:

* Write, structure, and manage the Get Started content, including OAuth and Security information
* Collaborate with the developers to update the JSON file each release, update the tables for added, modified, or deprecated endpoints and fields
* Write or edit the API descriptions and error messages
* Review or update sample code
* Publish API reference information using Swagger API

### **Integration Documentation**

**Context**: Primavera Cloud integrates with Oracle and third-party applications using APIs, PIMS, plug-ins, or prebuilt adapters/connectors and recipes. I have been working on the integration documentation since the very beginning and have seen several changes to the integration strategy which required creating documentation from scratch. I write the integration documentation for the prebuilt adapters/connectors and recipes for the Construction & Engineering suite of products. I also created documentation for the Zapier plug-in for Primavera Cloud.

**Contributions**:

My contributions to the project include the following:

* Create integration guides for Project Integration Management System (PIMS) for integrating Primavera Cloud with Microsoft Project, P6 EPP
* Create integration guide for Zapier plug-in for Primavera Cloud to easily synchronize third-party apps with Primavera Cloud using Zapier
* Draft integration guides for the prebuilt adapters/connectors and recipes for all C&E products that help integration engineers to easily integrate using a low-code or no-code approach

### **Help Documentation**

**Context:** Context-sensitive help documentation is available from a help panel inside the Primavera Cloud application.

**Project Link:**[ https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/87926.htm#t87926](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E80480_01/87926.htm#t87926)

**Contribution:**

My contributions to the project include the following:

* Decide what topics are good candidates for the Help panel
* Plan the structure and flow of topics in the library closely matching the UI
* Write in a minimalist and user friendly tone

### **High Compliance (FedRamp/IL4)**

I work on the High Compliance (FedRamp – IL4) documentation for Primavera Cloud. The high compliance versions of the standard solutions are intended for clients (mainly federal) with special compliance requirements, primarily around information security. I review and edit the narratives for various control families and include them in the System Security Plan (SSP) and Authorization Packages (APs) supplied by the FedRamp or other federally accredited agencies.

### **Analytics**

I  create and maintain the analytics reports for all C&E product documentation on Oracle Help Center. These metrics help documentation managers and writers provide visibility on how documents are performing and decide a documentation strategy for their teams.

## **Instructional Design**

### **SAP/ERP Training Development Projects**

Starting out, I worked as an Instructional Design Consultant at Accenture Deloitte and have vast experience in creating training material for SAP or ERP implementations. My deliverables included eLearning, instructor-led training, user guides, quick reference guides, and guided learning.

While working on SAP, I was proficient in the following modules – Procurement-to-Payment (PP), Finance and Controlling (FICO), Accounts Payable (AP), Materials Management (MM).

I also worked on other ERP systems such as PeopleSoft.

### **Non-ERP Training Development Projects**

I worked on creating training materials for a software application portal called ePharmaOne, which was a suite of applications that help clinical trial sites manage their clinical trials more efficiently. In addition to eLearning and ILTs, my deliverables included video training created using Camtasia.
